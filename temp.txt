I have 2 large cysts on my neck that hurt so bad that I had to have my girlfriend pop them yesterday.

They aren't painful anymore. Just dry and hard.  I'm wondering if I should get them drained for $30 at the local urged care or just let them ride at this point? Any advice with this? 

Meds: acanya in the am, Tretinoin in the pm, cerave moisturizer
